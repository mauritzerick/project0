### Instructions ###
Play the game that takes seconds to learn but weeks to build: **TIC TAC TOE**

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.


### Bugs
* Hover effect disappeared after initial game completed.
* Game won't load properly in different screen devices due to CSS bugs.

### What I would do better in a future version
* local storage.
* Board variations.
* Support networked multiplayer.
* creating the tic tac toe with simpler and shorter logic.
* An AI or computer player. This can be done by adding random function.
