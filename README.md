### Instructions ###
Play the game that takes seconds to learn but weeks to build: **TIC TAC TOE**


### Bugs
* Hover effect disappeared after initial game completed.
* Game won't load properly in mobile devices due to CSS bugs.

### What I would do better in a future version
* local storage.
* Board variations.
* Support networked multiplayer.
* creating the tic tac toe with simpler and shorter logic.
* An AI or computer player. This can be done by adding random function.
